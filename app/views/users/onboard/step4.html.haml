  %h1 Okay, so what can I expect as a mentor?
  %br
  %h2 1) You share your knowledge
  %br
  %p It is very valuable for startups to have a way of learning from the experience of others.  We hope that with your experience you can share some of your knowledge with your startups.
  %br 
  %h2 2) You give feedback 
  %br
  %p Check out what the startups are working on each week and provide help / feedback any way you can.  The expectation is that a startup will have a variety of mentors and will bennifit from having a variety of opinions.
  %br
  %h2 3) After 4 weeks you get new startups
  %br
  %p The expectation of the startups is that you will only mentor each of them for 4 weeks.  That way if it is not a good fit, you can move on.  This means that at the end of the 4 weeks, unless you request otherwise, you will get to meet 4 more startups. 
  %br
  %h2 4) You can take a break
  %br
  %p If for any reason you need to take a break from being a mentor, that is totally fine and we will welcome you back when you decided it is right for you again.
