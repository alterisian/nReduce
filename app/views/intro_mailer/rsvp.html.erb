        nReduce is just a week away! We have over 250 teams registered all around the world. We're looking forward to getting things rolling <strong>June 5th</strong> for our first dinner.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 16px !important; line-height: 1.6">
        If you're on a registered nReduce startup team, <strong>please RSVP</strong> to our weekly dinner so we can organize the appropriate event space for each city.
        <strong>
          <%= link_to @confirm_url, @confirm_url %>
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 16px !important; line-height: 1.6">
        If you haven't registered yet, what are you waiting for!? :) Register your team here:
        <strong>
          <%= link_to @register_url, @register_url %>
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 16px !important; line-height: 1.6">
        Please note: you'll be directed to login via twitter for us to verify that you're on a registered nReduce team. We'll do all our authentication through twitter going forward. We figure it's better than having to remember yet another username/password.
      </p>
