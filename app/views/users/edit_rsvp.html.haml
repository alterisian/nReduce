        We're getting set up for our first nReduce meetup on <strong>June 5th, 2012 at 6:30pm</strong> (in your local timezone). To help organize the events, we'll need a few details.

      %p
        Each team member needs to RSVP. Please forward the RSVP link (<strong><a href="#{Settings.site_url}/rsvp">#{Settings.site_url}/rsvp</a></strong>) to your team members:
        %br
        %strong= current_startup.team_members.select{|member| member != "@#{current_auth.twitter}"}.join(", ")
      %p
        If you are anywhere near one of our locations we strongly encourage you to attend our in person dinner. Otherwise select "Virtual" and we'll send you instructions on how you can participate online.
