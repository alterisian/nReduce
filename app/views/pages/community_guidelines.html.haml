		%p nReduce is about helping entrepreneurs build great companies, create jobs and change the world. To do that we create rules and expectations which support that. Our community guidelines are a core part of these expectations. 

		%p Being that we are a community of creators and builders, we expect that each team member is engaged and each week provides useful feedback/support to each team in their group who posts an after video. 

		%p You can decide which teams to accept into your group and how many teams you would like to invest in building a relationship with. If a team is not providing good feedback, feel free to remove them from your group.
